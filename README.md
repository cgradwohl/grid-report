## Application Design

#### Mustache Templating and jQuery
Since this challenge awarded bonus points for using vanilla javascript, I wanted build the application without an MVC framework.

Mustache.js is a minimal template library that works well with jQuery. However, since it lacks data binding, it made rendering complex components challenging.

#### EVENT MEDIATOR
This Project uses a version of the publish/subscribe and mediator pattern to handle all events as well as state transfer in the application.
